## 🎯 Vision

KB Labs Workflow is a workflow orchestration engine that enables declarative workflow definitions, job scheduling, step execution, and distributed coordination through Redis. It provides a unified interface for running multi-step workflows across the KB Labs ecosystem.

The project solves the problem of orchestrating complex multi-step operations (like CI/CD pipelines, data processing, and plugin workflows) by providing a reliable, scalable workflow engine with support for dependencies, retries, concurrency control, and observability.

This project is part of the **@kb-labs** ecosystem and integrates seamlessly with CLI, REST API, Studio, and all plugin systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development mode for all packages
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { WorkflowEngine, createRedisClient } from '@kb-labs/workflow-engine'
import type { WorkflowSpec } from '@kb-labs/workflow-contracts'

const redis = await createRedisClient({
  url: process.env.KB_REDIS_URL || 'redis://localhost:6379'
})

const engine = new WorkflowEngine({
  redis,
  logger: getLogger('workflow')
})

const spec: WorkflowSpec = {
  name: 'my-workflow',
  version: '0.1.0',
  jobs: {
    build: {
      steps: [
        { name: 'build', uses: 'plugin:@kb-labs/build/cli' }
      ]
    }
  }
}

const run = await engine.run(spec, {
  idempotency: 'build-123'
})
```

## ✨ Features

- **Declarative Workflows**: YAML/JSON workflow definitions with jobs, steps, and dependencies
- **Job Scheduling**: Intelligent job scheduling with dependency resolution and concurrency control
- **Step Execution**: Support for in-process and sandboxed plugin command execution
- **Redis Coordination**: Distributed coordination through Redis for multi-worker setups
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry policies for jobs and steps
- **Observability**: Event streaming, logging, and metrics integration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation

- Concurrency control and idempotency

**@kb-labs/workflow-runtime** provides step execution:
- Local runner for in-process execution
- Sandbox runner for plugin command execution
- Context management and environment setup
- Signal handling and cancellation

**@kb-labs/workflow-contracts** defines the workflow specification:
- Zod schemas for validation
- TypeScript types for all workflow entities
- Example workflow definitions
